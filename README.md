  CLI TicTacToe is a simple implementation of the well-known 'Tic-Tac-Toe' game, for two players, which uses the command line as its user-interface.

## Description ##
  'CLI TicTacToe' allows people to play Tic-Tac-Toe even in the absence of a GUI operting system.
  
## Solution ##
  By using simply text print-outs to represent a game board, 'CLI TicTcToe' is able to represent a 2-D game board without requiring any GUI support. This allows the game to be played even in tiny, restricted technical spaces, such as embedded-system readouts or consumer appliances.

## How to Get Started ##
  To play, simply invoke the executable file ('ttt-cli.exe'). On-screen prompts guide the players.
  
## Customer Quote ##
  "My friend and I figured out how to play tic-tac-toe on the display of my utility-company meter!"
